It was a Sunday afternoon. I was on my way to a local grocery shop to
replenish my groceries for the weekend. On the way there, I witnessed an 
accident. A car was speeding down the road while the traffic lights were
slowly turning red. In that split second, I looked on as I saw a few teenagers
who were talking to each other while crossing the street as they did not pay
attention to the speeding car. As expected, the car could not hit the brakes
in time and crashed into the group of teenagers and then into the sidewalks.
